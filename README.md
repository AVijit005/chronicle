# Chronicle

> "A quiet place to remember every story you've lived."

Chronicle is a premium, beautifully crafted personal media tracking platform. It allows users to track their movies, books, games, anime, and podcasts in a single, unified library. Rather than just acting as a database, Chronicle functions as a "memory capsule," providing intelligent resurfacing, mood reflections, and dynamic journaling.

## Features

- **Universal Library:** Track movies, TV shows, anime, books, games, podcasts, and courses all in one place.
- **Intelligent Dashboard:** A beautifully designed dashboard that surfaces weekly reflections, living statistics, and quiet recommendations.
- **Collections & Taxonomies:** Build dynamic collections with cover galleries, heatmaps, and interconnected relationship maps.
- **Memory Insights:** View your lifetime statistics, completion graphs, and behavioral patterns using our proprietary analytics engine.
- **Journal & Timeline:** An immersive chronological feed of your cultural consumption, allowing for deep emotional reflection.
